# MQTT Dog Door Controller

This was a project ti integrate my dog door with my home automation system.

There is nothing complex going on here, this integrates with MQTT just as a window shade does.

This is one of those kinda silly things...that makes my life a bit better :).


## I have this running in my house using:
 - Arduindo: [Arduino R4](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/uno-r4-wifi)
 - Motor Controller: [Arduino Motor Shield](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-motor-shield-rev3)
 - Limit Switch: https://www.amazon.com/HUAREW-Vertical-Mechanical-3018-PROVer-3018-MX3/dp/B0B38YP135?th=1
 - Motor: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F8TGB9L?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_11&th=1
 - Dog Door: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNCRBRM1?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_4&th=1

 ## Future Work
  - I want to build something so that Oakley knows the dog door is closed from the outside :|.
